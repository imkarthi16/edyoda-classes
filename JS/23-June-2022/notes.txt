AJAX : Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
AJAX helps us in sending the data from/to, frontend/backend
client/server.

XML : Extensible Markup Language
<user-data>
    <fname>John</fname>
    <lname>Doe</lname>
</user-data>

JSON : JavaScript Object Notation
userData: {
    fname: John,
    lname: Doe
}

1. Send data to the server
2. Get the data from the server


Note : To get the data from the server we need a URL
This URL is called as API end point.


Methods to get/send data to an API End point 
E.g of API END point : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/

Methods : 
1. GET : Used to get some data from an API end point
2. POST : Used to send data to server to create/save something. 
3. PUT/PATCH : Used to request a change in data at the server.
4. DELETE : Used to delete some data on the server. 

API : Application Programming Interface

REST API : Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface

While working with AJAX, we need 2 important things
1. API end point
2. Method (HTTP Method)


HTTP Status Code :

Success Codes 2xx
200 : Ok
201 : Created

Failure Code (Client) 4xx
400 : Bad Request
401 : Unauthorized
403 : Forbidden
404 : Not Found
#429 : Limit Reached 


Server Failure (Server) 5xx
500 : Internal Server Error
502 : Bad Gateway
503 : Service Unavailable
504 : Gateway Timeout


AJAX Properties : 
readyState : Which gives us information about the state of our api call
States : 
1 : Not yet sent / Unsent : Order is placed, not yet dispatched
2 : Opened : Order is picked up by the courier
3 : Awaiting/Loading : Order is in transit
4 : Done (Success/Failure) : Order is delivered


200 : My order is correct and received
400 : My order is damanged
404 : Empty box received

readyStateChange : This is an event which triggers everytime when there is a change in readyState



Conversion between JSON/String : 
JSON to String : JSON.stringify(input);
String to JSON : JSON.parse(input);
