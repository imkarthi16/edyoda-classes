DSA => Data Structures and Algorithm
     (Allign Datas)

Example : Data Structures

const userNames = "John"
const userNames = "Jane" ===> here is two variable define it's simple thing okey
                              But more than variable declare how to this thing DSA 
                              organise a Datas
const userNames = ['John','Jane'] ===> organise a data using (Array).


Algorithm => Step by step procedure to solve problem.

Example : Algorithm

function sum(num1,num2){
    const result = num1+num2;
    return result;
}

step1 : create a function with name sum
step2 : Take 2 arguments num1 and num2
step3 : Add them using + operator
step4 : Store the result in a variable "result"
step5 : Return the value of total variable.

Stack ? => A collection of items kept on top of each other.

last item to be kept in stack is first one to come out of the stack
(LIFO - Last in first out)
